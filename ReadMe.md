# SE4030 â€“ Secure Software Development - Group Assignment 

In this assignment for SE4030 â€“ Secure Software Development, our team has focused on identifying and mitigating various security vulnerabilities in the original application. By employing security best practices and utilizing tools like Snyk, we have enhanced the application's resilience against common threats, such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), and Sensitive Data Exposure. Our goal is to ensure that the application meets functional requirements and adheres to robust security standards.
